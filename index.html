            <h2>Sexually Transmitted Infections (STI)</h2>
            <p>Sexually transmitted infections (STIs) continue to be a significant public health issue across Europe, with rising trends in cases of diseases like chlamydia, gonorrhea, and syphilis over the past decade. 
                The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) has highlighted that young adults, particularly those aged 15-24, are among the most affected demographics. Factors contributing to this increase 
                include changing sexual behaviors, inadequate sex education, and inconsistent use of protection during casual sexual encounters. Additionally, the growing prevalence of antibiotic-resistant strains, 
                especially in infections like gonorrhea, complicates treatment efforts and has become a critical area of concern. 
            </p>
            <p>European public health organizations are working on various strategies to combat this rising trend, including enhanced STI surveillance, awareness campaigns, and improved access to testing and treatment services. 
                Regular screenings and early diagnosis are essential in managing STIs, as many infections can be asymptomatic, meaning they often go undetected without routine testing. Comprehensive sex education, 
                particularly among teenagers and young adults, is emphasized to promote safe sexual practices and raise awareness about the risks associated with STIs.
            </p>    
            <p>Furthermore, the stigma surrounding STIs in certain parts of Europe often leads individuals to avoid seeking testing or treatment, exacerbating the spread. Collaborative efforts across European nations aim to 
                address this stigma and create a more open, supportive environment for individuals to discuss and manage their sexual health. The goal is to reduce transmission rates, enhance treatment outcomes, and 
                ensure that people have access to accurate information and resources to make informed choices about their sexual health.
