                <h2>2017</h2>
                <p>In 2017, the distribution of HIV and AIDS cases in European countries 
                    showed a relatively balanced gender split, with a slight difference 
                    between males and females. Males represented <b>49.4%</b> of the total cases, 
                    with a rate of 103.6 cases per 100,000 men, while females accounted for 
                    50.6% of the cases, with a slightly higher rate of 106 cases per 100,000 
                    women. This resulted in a 1.2% difference between the two genders in terms 
                    of overall case distribution. While historically HIV and AIDS have affected 
                    males more significantly in many regions, the near-equal distribution in 2017 
                    reflects an increasing impact on women in Europe. Factors such as biological 
                    susceptibility, social determinants of health, and healthcare access may contribute 
                    to this trend. The balance between the genders underscores the need for targeted 
                    public health strategies that address the needs of both men and women, ensuring equal
                     access to prevention, treatment, and care to reduce the overall burden of the disease
                     across all populations.</p>

                <h2>2018</h2>
                <p>In 2018, the distribution of HIV and AIDS cases in European countries showed a notable 
                    difference between males and females. Males accounted for 57.6% of the total cases, with
                     a rate of 108.4 cases per 100,000 men, while females represented 42.4% of the cases, with
                      a rate of 79.8 cases per 100,000 women. This resulted in a higher rate of HIV and AIDS 
                      cases among men compared to women, both in terms of percentage and total rate. The higher
                       rate among males suggests that, in 2018, men were more affected by the epidemic in Europe,
                        though the difference in prevalence between the genders is still significant. Factors 
                        such as social behaviors, risk factors, and access to healthcare may contribute to this 
                        disparity. Despite the higher rate among men, the data highlights the ongoing need for 
                        comprehensive public health strategies that address the specific needs of both genders, 
                        ensuring that prevention, treatment, and care services are accessible and effective for all.</p>

                <h2>2019</h2>
                <p>In 2019, the distribution of HIV and AIDS cases in European countries showed a shift compared 
                    to previous years, with males accounting for 54.6% of the total cases, reflecting a rate of 
                    87.9 cases per 100,000 men. In contrast, females represented 45.4% of the cases, with a rate 
                    of 73.2 cases per 100,000 women. Although males still made up a larger proportion of the cases,
                     the gap between genders had narrowed compared to earlier years. The total rate of cases was 
                     higher among men, but the difference in rates between the two genders had decreased, indicating
                      a potential trend of increased HIV and AIDS cases among women, though still at a lower rate. 
                      This shift could reflect changing patterns of infection, public health interventions, or 
                      improvements in access to healthcare. The data emphasizes the continued need for tailored public
                       health strategies that address the unique needs of both men and women, ensuring that all individuals
                        have access to prevention, treatment, and care services to manage and reduce the impact of HIV and 
                        AIDS in Europe.</p>

            <div id="description2020" class="year-description-box">
                <div id="year-label-2020"></div>
                <h2>2020</h2>
                <p>
                    In 2020, the distribution of HIV and AIDS cases in European countries showed a significant shift, with 
                    females making up the majority of reported cases. Females accounted for 70.9% of the total cases, reflecting
                     a rate of 38.2 cases per 100,000 women, while males represented only 29.1% of the cases, with a much lower rate
                      of 15.7 cases per 100,000 men. This marked change in the gender distribution indicates a notable increase in the
                       proportion of women affected by HIV and AIDS in 2020, while the overall rate of cases among men decreased 
                       substantially compared to previous years. Several factors could explain this shift, including changes in 
                       transmission patterns, improvements in prevention and treatment among men, or differences in access to care.
                        This data underscores the need for public health strategies that are increasingly focused on addressing the
                         specific needs of women, alongside continuing efforts to reach all populations, ensuring that both men and
                          women have access to the necessary resources for prevention, treatment, and care.</p>

            <div id="description2021" class="year-description-box">

                <h2>2021</h2>
                <p>
                    In 2021, the distribution of HIV and AIDS cases in European countries continued to show a pronounced gender disparity, 
                    with females representing a much larger share of the cases. Females accounted for 74.8% of the total cases, with a rate
                     of 68.4 cases per 100,000 women, while males made up just 25.2% of the cases, with a rate of 23 cases per 100,000 men. 
                     This data reveals a further increase in the proportion of women affected by HIV and AIDS, with the rate among females 
                     rising significantly compared to previous years. Meanwhile, the rate among males remained relatively low and showed a 
                     continued decrease in comparison to earlier years. These trends suggest that women in Europe may be facing a growing risk
                      of HIV and AIDS, which could be influenced by various factors such as changes in transmission dynamics, shifting patterns
                       of vulnerability, or improvements in care and prevention for men. The stark gender imbalance highlights the importance of
                        gender-sensitive public health strategies that specifically target the rising prevalence among women, ensuring equitable
                         access to prevention, education, and treatment for all individuals.</p>
